# Clutch-Rivet-Detection

Clutch plates are critical components in automotive and industrial machinery, and identifying the proper placement of rivets—both head and tail—is essential in real-world manufacturing and quality assurance scenarios. Incorrect or missing rivets can lead to structural failures, reduced performance, and safety issues. This project focuses on detecting and classifying rivet conditions using a computer vision model trained on clutch plate images, aiming to automate inspection and ensure production reliability.
